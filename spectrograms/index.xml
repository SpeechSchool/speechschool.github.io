      <description>A spectrogram visualizes how the frequencies of a sound change over time.
Time is on the x-axis and frequency is on the y-axis. The color of a pixel shows the magnitude of the frequency for the corresponding time inteval. Frequencies with the largest magnitudes are colored white, while those with the lowest magnitudes are colored black.
   Human Voice    A Spectrogram of the human voice will have equally spaced stripes.</description>

      <description>Sound is the result of air pressure varying over time. We can represent a sound by a graph with time on the x-axis and amplitude of the air pressure variation on the y-axis, which we call a signal.
  Air pressure vs time   This time based representation of sound is convenient for recording and playing back sound, but we can have little idea of what such a signal will sound like.</description>
