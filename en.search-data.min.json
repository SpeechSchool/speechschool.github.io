We perceive the articulation of a vowel, as described by the Wood vowel model, rather than the formant frequencies. Thus we will give each articulation of the Wood vowel model a symbol from the IPA.

If one presses on the balloon, the force of the air pressure will overcome the elastic force of the rubber band, allowing some air to escape from the rubber band. However, as the air escapes the air pressure will drop and the streatched rubber band will close again temporarily until the person pressing on balloon creates enough pressure to overcome the elastic force of the rubber band once more. The repetition of this cycle creates a sound.  Sorry, your browser doesn't support HTML5 video.   When this occurs sufficiently fast, the rubber band will effectively be bouncing of itself. This is a good way to think about the vocal cords. When vocal cords are bouncing of each other cleanly a clear sound is produces. When the bounce is scuffed a disonant sound results.\nMovement    The vocal cords at one end are attached together to the same bone. However, the other ends are attached different bones that move freely in the tranverse plane. A lateral movement of these ends of the vocal cords while phonating, will cause a greater amount of air will escape resulting in a breathy voice. A posterior movement of the free ends will streatch out the vocal cords, and the greater tension cause the vocal cords to ossicaliate faster resulting in a higher pitch. People with thicker and longer vocal cords will have deeper voices as their vocal cords cannot ossicaliating as fast.\n  Advanced Bouncing    The vocal cords bounce of each other in a rolling motion.

Raise Verbal IQ    Recent IQ gains have mostly been due to gains in mathmatical specialized abilities. Use the speech school to develope specialized verbal abilities.  Crisp Vowel Class    Speech teachers are expensive and boring way to reach the crisp vowel class. Self-teach with pedagogical technology.  Recreational Self-improvement    Nothing is more rewarding than accumulating somatic capital.   Singing Therapy    Singing out your pain with the dignity of having a systematic method to improve.  Recreational Learning    Phonetics is fascinating and useful.  Quit Video Games    Your time spend practicing will actually be rewarded with real life status.   "},{"id":29,"href":"/categories/","title":"Categories","parent":"","content":""},{"id":30,"href":"/methodology/","title":"Methodology","parent":"","content":"Speech school is a methodology that usilizes software for those who can practice obsessively.\nPhonological awareness    Phonetic literacy is a critical specialized ability to develop if you want to be considered intelligent. Many high IQ people will develop it naturally and it allows them to distinguish themselves from the rest.\nHowever, those with a non-verbal IQ tilt will need help to develope phonological awareness. We will train phoneme segmentation we by typing out a phonetic transcription of a text, with the computer testing accuracy.\nPercetion    The main problem we have is that we are unable to how we sound as we are speaking or singing. You propable find listening to a recording of youself very unpleasent, but not otherwise. This is the main problem to overcome. And we will practice obsessively to develope the ability to know how we actually sound while speaking.\nThe speech school methodology is to watch or listen back to your practice sessions. This way we can create a memory of what we sound like. We can then associate this with the vibrations we feel to develope a accurate persecption of what we sound like in real time.\nTimbre    Timbre is all about the motion of vocal cord oscillation.\nSinging is a good way to work on your Timbre. Singing also exposes you timbre and vowel shaping much more so than speaking. Thus singing allows us to identify problems in our voices that we might not be able to only speaking.\nActivate the Imitation Reflex    Most people have a strong imitation reflex. When they see someone performing an action the same circuits in their brain activate as that activate when performing the action themselves.\nOn the other hand, people marvel how we can perform advanced mathematics. I can assure you that a functioning imitation reflex and the ability to perform advanced mathematics are muturally exclusive. Thus we will have to coax our imitation reflex for back into activation.\nBuilding Neuromusculature    The muscles of the larynx need to be developed, the same way bodybuilders develope muscles. The most difficult part of bodybuilding is actually developing the nervous system. Developing Neuromusculature is even more important for us as speaking and sings is about fine motor control.\nDeveloping respiratory control.    Breathing the right amount, quickly enough, is difficult.\nAccent    Accent is all abou shaping the vocal tract correctly.\nThe vowels are drawn out allowing you time to concentrate on your form.\nWe will use singing to train the ability to target a piticular vowel. Once we can consciously target the vowels we want, we cant then recite verse to drill our new accent into us.\nBe able to target vowels. Formant overlay. Be able to match accent for speech. Phoneme aligment engine. Be able to read with target accent. Dictation like accent checker.\n Hacks    Increasing pitch    Thinking of the pajoritive \u0026ldquo;Woo Girls\u0026rdquo;, you can get an idea of the upper limit of your pitch for your chest voice by shouting WOO! The pitch should peek in the middle of the woo. You should keep trying to strengthen your layrnx muscles untill you can sing a sustained note as loud as you can woo.\n"},{"id":31,"href":"/equipment/microphone/","title":"Microphone","parent":"Equipment","content":"Microphone    Proximity Effect    For most microphones as you move the sound source closer the lower frequiences will be amplified, the recorded sound will become darker. This is unsuitable for our purposes as we want our microphone recording to be comparable to professionally recorded audio.\nCondenser microphones have less proximity effect. Omnidirectional microphones have lower proxmity effect. Omnidirectional condenser microphones have virtually no proximity effect.\nFrequency Response    We want to get a microphone with a flat frequency response. However, you will have to pay for a flatter frequency response and a flat frequency response is not as important as getting a microphone with low proximity effect.\nBlue Snowball    Don\u0026rsquo;t get the Blue Snowball iCE! You must get the original Snowball, the one with the omnidirectional pattern. It is a cheap microphone with low proximity effect but the frequency response is what you would expect for the price.\nhttps://www.bluemic.com/en-us/products/snowball/\nHeadset microphones    The best sound is closest to the source. It\u0026rsquo;s a lot of work making sure to keep your mouth close to the mic. The solution to this is to buy a headset microphone so you are free to sway around. The problem with headset microphones is that they are mono with connectors designed to work with wireless sytems not the computer\u0026rsquo;s stero 3.5 input jack or an USB audio interface\u0026rsquo;s XLR input which is an added cost.\nRode smartLav+ + Rode Lav-Headset + SC3    The Lav-Headset is clunky, but I have tested the SC3 and the adaptor works with my computer.\nDon\u0026rsquo;t get the original smartLav, you must get the plus version.\nhttp://www.rode.com/microphones/smartlav-plus\nhttp://www.rode.com/accessories/lav-headset\nhttp://www.rode.com/accessories/sc3\nSamson DE10x    This might be a bit risky as I do not know how best to get it to work with the computer. Maybe a mono to stero adaptor will work with the computers 3.5 jack, although I failed to make it work for my DPA headset because with TRS and TRRS jacks you cannot be sure whether the microphone is wired to come out of the tip, ring or sleeve, and what tip, ring, sleeve configuration the adapter is wired for.\nhttp://www.samsontech.com/samson/products/microphones/headworn-microphones/de10x/\nCountryman H6 (or DPA 4266) + Rode AI1    This will be expensive but you can get a XLR connector which will work with a USB audio interface.\nhttps://countryman.com/product/h6-headset/\nhttps://www.dpamicrophones.com/headset/flex-omnidirectional-headset-microphone\nhttps://www.rode.com/interfaces/ai1\n  "},{"id":32,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"","content":""},{"id":33,"href":"/pedagogy/timbre/","title":"Timbre","parent":"Pedagogical Terms","content":"Timbre describes the quality of the sound source which is best visualized by the shape of the spectral slice.
